Secure Multiparty Computing (MPC) is a heated research field in cryptography with the goal of creating methods for
multiple parties to jointly contribute to the computation while keeping the input private to each party.

RSA encryption algorithm, which requires lots of computations involving multiplication and modulus on large prime
numbers, is suitable to be modified to working in an MPC scenario.

This project aims to implement a containerized MPC module for RSA keypair generation and message decryption.

Project collaborators are Gyeonjun Lee ([7942jun](https://github.com/7942jun)), Hexiang
Geng ([CuriousLocky](https://github.com/CuriousLocky)) and Minghang Lee ([Matchy](https://github.com/matchy233)).

## Build and Run the Project

### Build from source

We use `Gradle` to manage and build the project. Simply run the following command if you have `Gradle` installed on your
machine:

```bash
$ gradle clean build
```

If you don't have `gradle` installed, you can build with the `Gradle` wrapper:

```bash
$ gradlew clean build
```

After running either command, you can find the executable in `/app/build/distributions/`. Extract `app.tar` or `app.zip`
and run `app` to use the app.

Note that the way of compiling and running the application is subject to change.

## Commit Message Conventions

There are two popular ways of writing a commit
message: [Tim Pope style](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) (This is also
recommended in the official guideline of
Git, [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project)), and
the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style. The latter one is preferred in many
large open-source projects since it dovetails [SemVer](https://semver.org/). Here we adopt the Tim Pope style, for its
succinctness.

Here are the 7 rules for writing a good Tim Pope style commit message:

1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
2. Capitalize *only* the first letter in the subject line.
3. *Don't* put a period at the end of the subject line.
4. Put a blank line between the subject line and the body.
5. Wrap the body at 72 characters.
6. Use the imperative mood, but not past tense.
7. Describe *what* was done and why, but not *how*.

Read [this nice blog post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for explanation on why we set up those rules.
